# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my experience in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Each project highlights different aspects of the field, from data visualization and analysis to machine learning and AI. I am continuously working on new projects. Explore my work and feel free to connect with me for any collaboration or inquiries.

## Projects

### [Airbnb](projects/airbnb)

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize Airbnb data for the city of Porto, Portugal. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects such as pricing trends, popular neighborhoods, and availability.

### [Hyperparameter Tuning with MS-EPSO](projects/hyperparameters)

In this project, I applied the Maximum Search Limitations Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (MS-EPSO) algorithm for hyperparameter tuning of the XGBoost model. The MS-EPSO algorithm successfully optimized several hyperparameters, resulting in a model that achieved an accuracy of 90.43% on the test set.

### [Classification with an Academic Success Dataset](projects/academic_success)

This project is part of my current solution for the Kaggle competition titled "Classification with an Academic Success Dataset." In this notebook, I present an approach based on data processing, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation.
