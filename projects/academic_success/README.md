# Classification with an Academic Success Dataset

This project is my current solution for the Kaggle competition titled "Classification with an Academic Success Dataset."

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating different machine learning models to find the best performing one.
- **Out-of-Fold Prediction**: Implementing out-of-fold prediction to improve model robustness.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on the test set.

## Usage

Open `classification.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore the entire process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
