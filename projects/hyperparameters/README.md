# Hyperparameter Tuning with MS-EPSO

In this project, I applied the Maximum Search Limitations Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (MS-EPSO) algorithm for hyperparameter tuning of the XGBoost model using the Breast Cancer dataset. The MS-EPSO algorithm successfully optimized several hyperparameters, resulting in a model that achieved an accuracy of 90.43% on the test set.

## Features

- **MS-EPSO Implementation**: An implementation of the MS-EPSO algorithm in Python.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Efficient tuning of XGBoost hyperparameters using MS-EPSO.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Usage

Open `tuning.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore the hyperparameter tuning process and results.

## Files

- **msepso.py**: Contains the implementation of the MS-EPSO algorithm.
